Ideal applicants should have a strong Master's degree (for PhD applicants) or PhD degree (for Post-doctoral fellows) in
civil engineering, geotechnical engineering, or computer science. Candidates with a solid background in laboratory
tests, numerical studies, machine learning, data analytics, or statistics will have an advantage.

Interested and qualified candidates are encouraged to email a 2-page CV to Prof. Louis Wong (LNYWONG@hku.hk). The
positions are available until filled, but PhD scholarship applications received before December 1, 2023, will be given
higher priority for consideration.
